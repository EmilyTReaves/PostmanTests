# PostmanTests
A Collection of tests I've written in Postman for various API projects/validations

Overview
I'm a QA Analyst from a non-technical background who wants to help other QA testers and Analysts learn to validate APIs/begin transitioning their testing from manual to more automated. I've got over a decade of manual testing experience and have spent the past few years exploring the best way(s) to teach myself code & test automation. Throughout this time I've experienced multiple periods of frustration with how little information there was available about automated testing & API testing written to/from a wholly QA perspective, vs. from those with engineering backgrounds/already fully versed in code. If the latter is you this project might be like learning the alphabet. But if you're about to give up attempting API testing because you can't figure out the difference between a string, number, endpoint, variable, or why when you try something it says "undefined"â€”you're in the right place.


Setup
Make sure you have installed Postman
(if you have a GitHub account) fork and/or clone this repository (Forking is how you save/favorite)
(if not) favorite/save the link
Download the collection called [___ ] located inside this repository. You will need it for Step 1

Step 1
Summary
In this step, we'll use the import function to add a collection of existing requests (tests) to Postman.

Instructions
Open Postman.
Click on the import button located in the top left corner of Postman.
On your machine, locate the collection file called [___ ] that you downloaded above. Select it.
After importing, you should have a collection called [___ ] on the left side of your Postman. If you click on it, the list of requests should expand/close.

Step 2
Summary
In this step, we'll Send a New test/request (from inside the collection we imported in Step 1 above) to validate [___ ].

Click on the first request from the collection [___ ].
When you click the blue Send button you should see all the [___ ] data in the Body tab.
Click on the Tests tab.
On the far right, under "Snippets", you can scroll to find a snippet of existing code for a test that checks that the status code is 200 and use that to build off as you write/edit your own test ("Status Code: Code is 200".) This is not the ONLY way to check status, but an example.
Create a test that checks [___ ], and place/write it directly underneath the Status 200 test.
Click on Send again to see if your tests pass or fail.
